HEURISTICS AS TOOLS

Engineering: Laws, formulae
SA: Experience based knowledge

Heuristics as abstractions of experience
    - Pass on experience and knowledge to others

    - Selected heuristics
        - Do not assume that the original statement of the problem is necessarily the best or even the right one

Trading Complexity

    System
        - Large number of simple sub systems
            - large number of interfaces
            - keep complexity at system level

        - Small number of complex sub systems
            - give complexity to sub systems

    - In partitioning, choose the elements so that they are as independent as possible
    - Choose elements with low external complexity and high internal complexity
    - ex. Integrated circuits (ICs)

    - A model is not reality
    - If it can fail it will

    - The eye is a fine architect. Believe it
    - Simplify stuff
    - Build and maintain options as long as possible in design and implementation of complex systems.


CRITERIA FOR SELECTING HEURISTICS

    1. The heuristic must make sense in the original domain
    2. The general sense should apply beyond original domain
        - before: opinion
        - after: obvious
    3. Short to the point, easy to rationalize
    4. Should have stood the test of time

USING HEURISTICS
    - When to use heuristics?
        - guides to evoke new thoughts
        - integrated in design and development
        - heuristics are important in the beginning

PROCESS FRAMEWORKS FOR ARCHITECTING HEURISTICS

    Top level steps followed by an architect at the beginning of the program

    - ORIENTATION: Where you are and where you want to go
    - CORE ARCHITECTING
        1. Purpose analysis
            - Purpose analysis: Why capabilities of desired system has value
            - (Don't under estimate the value of the system)

        2. Problem structuring [Harmonigation]
            - You have to put some logical structure in your problem

        3. Solution structuring [Harmonigation]
            - You should have at least 2-3 solutions instead of just 1
            - Pick the best solution

        4. Selection abstraction
            - There are some selection criteria
            - Make the selection criteria before the results of the solution

USING HEURISTICS
    - They guide to evoke new thoughts
    - Integrated in design and development
    - Heuristics are important in the beginning

HEURISTICS ON HEURISTICS

    - GENERATING USEFUL HEURISTICS
        - Careful choice of words
        - Should transmit meaning
        - Not just understandable to you
        - No conditionals

    - APPLYING HEURISTICS
        - If it works it is useful
        - Knowing when and how to use it is as important as the heuristic itself
        - Works best when applied early
        - Practice
        - Not reality

    - TAXONOMY OF HEURISTICS
        - Descriptive
            - Describing situation
        - Prescriptive
            - Offers situation
