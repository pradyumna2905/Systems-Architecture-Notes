MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS

Manufacturing Domain:
  - Is a system
  - Historically looked as one step in production system engineering
  - Historically slow changing system/process
  - 20 years global competition picked up
  - Manufacturing looked upon as an area where competition can affect

Innovations
  - UQ Manufacturing
      - UQ Systems must have UQ manuf
      - Planned obsolescence
      - Reliability is a must
      - Must have quality (absence of defect)
      - Does not break down
      - No delay in manuf
      - Testing can be reduced
      - No spare parts

      - Repair policy (Reflects cost)
        - Full
          - washing machine
        - Partial
          - laptop
        - No repair
          - cell phone

      - 5 WHYs (Why did it go wrong?)

      - System failure
        - More complexity, more chance of failure

      - UQ at all points
        - Culture is very important in UQ
        - Ex: Apple, iPhone box

      - No negative work environment

      - Pride in work
        - Like your work
        - Like what you do
        - Fix it right then

  - Dynamic Manufacturing
    1 Intersecting waterfalls
      - Manuf design and dev process is usually longer than system/product
      - When 2 parallel processes (one fast and other slow) creates problems
      - Do not underestimate uncertainty between two processes

    2 Software integration
      - More higher in manufacturing
      - Adds another layer of complexity

    3 Challenge: Sync up

    4 Spiral and spiral to circle
      - In software dev

      - Other applications
        - Fly-before buy form
        - Operational prototype

  - Flexible Manufacturing
    - 2 types
      - Make to order
      - Multiple products

  - Lean Production/ Just in Time
    - Started in 1960s
    - But implementation not effective
    - Includes feedback (cannot work without it)
    - Very high quality
    - Bake quality in design
    - TQM (Total Quality Management)
    - JIT (Just in Time)
      - No inventory
      - Parts come, assemble
      - DELL

Manufacturing Scenarios:
  - Full development with serial production
      - Full design development
      - Test process
      - BUILD PROTOTYPES by performing QUALIFICATION TESTING
      - Mass production

  - Incremental development and release
      - Software heavy
      - Build prototypes
      - Each prototype self sufficient and full function
      - No manufacturing and distribution cost
      - Only Testing and certification

  - Proto flight dev and manuf
      - Hardware heavy
      - No prototype
      - Not for mass production
      - Just final product is launched
      - 1/2 products
      - Ex: Satellite
      - testing
        - cannot overtest
        - cannot not test
        - cannot damage product

Concurrent Engineering
  - Strategy to design and dev products
  - Different stages run simultaneously, rather than consecutively
  - Decreases development time and time to market
  - Improved productivity and reduced cost

Feedback Systems:
  - Drawbacks:
    - Complexity
    - Unstability

  - Types:
    - External
      - Customer feedback
        - Get feedback from customer to improve product/service

      - Supplier feedback
        - Provide feedback to supplier
        - Monitor supplier to ensure quality, schedule, cost

    - Internal
      - Quality
        - Quality is designed into system and process
        - In manuf process, monitor feedback and quality
      - Process

Feedback time delay OR Loop delay
  - Time between information feedback to potential change in production
  - Should be small but not too small
  - Process fast, but not too fast

  - Delays due to [NOT ACCEPTABLE]
    - Making design changes
    - Correcting supply problems
    - Responding to customer complaints
    - New products and reacting to competitors

Anticipating feedback
  - Try to anticipate the future of market for product
  - Basically it is on supplier side
  - Risk involved

Bad feedback design
  - Result in system instability

  - Symptoms
    - Inventory chaos (You produce too much or too less)
    - Unscheduled overtime
    - Frustrated suppliers
    - Departing long time customers

Properly designed feedback
  - Better transient and statistic reference
  - Reduced delays and resonance
    - Resonance
      - Oscillations within a system
      - Oscillations are resonance
      - Want to control frequency and amplitude of resonance

  - Reduced non linearities
  - Control of quality
  - Minimize inventory

  - Parameters
    - Inventory size
    - Inventory replacement capacity
    - Information acquisition and processing time
    - Supplier capacity
    - Management of response time

  - System response
    - Time market
    - Material flow rate
    - Information flow rate
    - Inventory replacement rate
    - Employee turn over rate


Some intuitions about feedback
  - Behavior different
  - Feedback fundamentally changes system
  - Design of system is critical
  - Feedback can compensate for disturbance but not at the margins
  - When feedback is introduced the entire feedback needs to be redesigned
  - Feedback wold compensate for noise (but not extreme noise), within system operating range

Characteristics of non linear systems:
  - Non linear system behavior is unpredictable
  - Majority systems are non linear
  - Very small changes in input amplitude could result in big changes in output
  - Non linear systems are higher risk
  - Involves saturation

  - 2 kinds of non linearity
    1. Intentional
      - Ex. Controller for AC - ON/OFF depends on temperature

    2. Unwanted linearity
      - Try to get rid or in control of them
      - Control
        - Tight control
          - Observe output
          - Slight change
          - Make change
        - Local feedback
