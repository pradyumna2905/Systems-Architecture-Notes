SOCIAL SYSTEMs

Social + Technical = Sociotechnical systems

Socio technical systems:
  - Technical systems
  - Works involving social participation, interest and concerns
  - Ex:
    - Urban development
    - Roadways / Public Transportation
    - Health Systems

  - Somewhat socio technical systems:
    - Ballistic missile defense
    - Nuclear power stations

  - Public Participation
    - Direct use by public
    - Public is the end user
    - Public must have personal responsibility and civic approach when using these systems

  - Demand determines size of socio technical systems
  - Socio technical systems are a form of collaborative systems
  - Other category of socio technical systems are NASA, DoD
    - No direct participation but public benefit from them

FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIO TECHNICAL SYSTEMS:
  - Design / Development / Operations are as before
    - Systems approach
    - Purpose
    - Modeling
    - Certification
    - Insight and Heuristics
    - UQ

  - High Quality or UQ?
    - For some we have UQ (Nuclear power stations)
    - Public health systems - you want HQ, not UQ

Separation of client and user
  - Customer / Client (Government or a company) is not the end user (Public)
  - It results in potential conflict
  - To resolve conflicts:
      - Standards
      - Codes
      - Certification
