Systems definition
	- Set of interconnected things or parts forming a complex system

Complexity: 
	1. Number of elements
	2. Number of interconected nodes
	
Complexity of a system
	- One of the most important reasons for system failure is the under estimation of complexity
	
Need different techniques (design procedures/operational procedures to deal with complexity)
	1. Architecting Methods
	2. Heuristics
	3. Abstrations
	4. Integrated Modeling
	
Simplicity is the most important factor when dealing with complexity. How?
	1. Concentrated on essentials
	2. Consolidated and simplify objectives
	3. Put aside minor issues
	4. Model at highest level
	
Repressive Partitioning -> Dont destroy interfaces
Advancements in IT
	- software, smart systems, artificial intelligence (all these make a system very complex)
	- software gives 'character' to a system
	- before: 70% hardware, 30% software, now the other way around
